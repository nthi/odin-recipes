        <h1>Garlic Knots</h1>
        <img src="">
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>These garlic knots are based on the pizza
            dough recipe from <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/pizza-crust-recipe">
            King Arthur Baking</a>. I halved the dough recipe
            and tweaked it to create cheesy, garlicky, pizzeria-style
            garlic knots. Enjoy!
        </p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>3.5 oz warm water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil (veggie oil is fine)</li>
            <li>1.5 cups AP flour</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 huge garlic cloves, grated (one for the dough, one for the garlic butter. Go harder if you want.)</li>
            <li>2-4 oz finely shredded cheese (mozz, parm, and jack all work well, but sharp cheddar is rad too)</li>
            <li>2+ tbs butter (for the garlic butter. Eyeball this and follow your heart.)</li>
            <li>2+ teaspoons olive oil (or veggie oil. If you've upped the butter, up the oil by a bit.)</li>
            <li>Couple shakes garlic powder</li>
            <li>Couple shakes onion powder</li>
            <li>Tiny tiny pinch oregano</li>
            <li>Any other powdered spices you think sound nice. Black pepper, red pepper, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, add yeast, water, and a pinch of sugar. Let it sit until bubbly and expanded.</li>
            <li>Add the shredded cheese and stir a little to break it up in the warm water.</li>
            <li>Add flour, oil, salt, and grated garlic to the bowl. 
            <li>Mix and knead (by hand or with mixer/dough hook or bread machine) until the dough is smooth, soft, and not sticking to the sides of the bowl too bad.</li>
            <li>You may need to add a little water if your dough is shaggy and not pulling together (1/4 tsp at a time), or a little flour if it's sticky and clinging to the bowl (try adding 1/2 tbs at a time) </li>
            <li>Cover dough and let it rest in a warm spot for 30 minutes or until doubled.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.</li>
            <li>Fold and turn the dough about 8 times, adding a light sprinkle of flour if anything is too sticky to handle.</li>
            <li>Divide dough into 16 pieces (I like using a dough scraper or a pizza cutter.)</li>
            <li>Roll each piece into a long cylinder (3-4 inches) between lightly floured hands, then tie it in a knot.</li>
            <li>Place each knot on a lightly oiled sheet pan (or line the pan with baking parchment if you like).</li>
            <li>Optional: lightly brush knots with oil.</li>
            <li>Let the knots rise until they're a little puffier. I usually let them sit on the pan for 10-15 minutes after I've twisted the last knot.</li>
            <li>About halfway through the rising process, preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>When the knots have risen, TURN OVEN DOWN to 375 degrees Fahrenheit before you put them in the oven.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
            <li>While the knots bake, place butter, oil, grated garlic, and seasoning powders in a small saucepan or microwave safe bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat mixture until butter is melted, but don't let it bubble/brown. For microwaves, COVER bowl and start with 2 minutes at 10-or-20% power.</li>
            <li>Optional: when knots are golden brown, brush with some of the garlic butter and return to oven for about 2 more minutes.</li>
            <li>After the knots are done baking, dump them all in a big clean bowl/casserole/baking dish and pour or brush garlic butter on them.</li>
            <li>Use tongs to toss the knots around and get them coated evenly in garlic butter.</li>
            <li>Optional: once they're buttery, sprinkle some parmesan cheese all over them and toss again.</li>
            <li>Serve hot or warm!</li>
