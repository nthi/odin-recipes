    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>If you are like me, you can't get pre-packaged gnocchi in
       your local grocery store! The great news is that
       it's relatively easy to make gnocchi from scratch
       if you've got potatoes, egg, and flour. It takes a couple hours
       start to finish, but about half of that time is passive (the potatoes
       are baking). Recipe adapted from <link a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/easy-gnocchi-recipe/">
       Natasha's Kitchen.</link>
       Makes 4 servings. Enjoy!

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large potatoes (I use 8 small). Around 2lbs if you have a scale.</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup AP flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>Optional: couple shakes garlic powder</li>
        <li>Optional: couple shakes onion powder</li>
    
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash, pierce, and bake the potatoes until you can easily poke them through with a butter knife (try a preheated oven at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 45-60 minutes).</li>
        <li>Let the potatoes cool.</li>
        <li>While the potatoes cool, mix your flour together with the salt and spices.</li>
        <li>After mixing the flour, beat your egg in a small bowl or ramekin. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Clean your counter! You're going to be using it to roll dough!</li>
        <li>Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle (but ideally still pretty warm), remove their peels.</li>
        <li>Prepare the potatoes:
            <ul>
                <li>If you have a potato ricer: cut potatoes into smaller pieces and rice them directly onto the clean counter.</li>
                <li>If you don't have a ricer: use a box grater to grate the potatoes directly onto the clean counter.</li>
                <li>Try and distribute your little potato piles in an even spread as you go, or gently scoot them around once you're done ricing/grating</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        <li>Drizzle your egg as evenly as you can over the spread out potatoes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle your flour/spice mix evenly over everything.</li>
        <li>Mix everything together.
            <ul>
                <li>If you have a bench scraper, use it to fold the mix over itself until the wet and dry ingredients are distributed more or less evenly.</li>
                <li>If you don't have a bench scraper, use your hands to fold the mix over itself until the wet and dry ingredients are distributed more or less evenly.</li>
                <li>Once it looks like a crumbly sticky mess, start gently kneading it together so that it becomes less "sticky-patches-and-crumbly-patches" and more "this is mashed potato dough"</li>
                <li>You can sprinkle a little flour over it if you've got super sticky trouble. Think 1 tbs or less at a time, though.</li>
                <li>Hint: You will have best results not working the dough too much. Pull it together in about 3 minutes or less. If it holds together and you can roll it into cylinders, stop kneading and move on.</li>
                <li>Think biscuits or dumplings, if you've made those before!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Once the dough holds together, form into a ball or log and set to one side of your workspace.</li>
        <li>Cut off about 1/8 of your dough to work with. Dust the counter with flour and roll the dough into a long cylinder.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You want a 1/2 inch diameter (or slightly smaller) cylinder.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Use your dough scraper, a rotary pizza cutter, or a knife to cut your cylinder into gnocchi. I like to cut them between 1/2 and 1 inch long.</li>
        <li>Dust your cut gnocchi with flour and scoot to the side of your workspace (or put in a large bowl or on a plate).</li>
        <li>Repeat with rest of dough.
            <ul>
                <li>I don't use anything to put ridges on my gnocchi. They're not as pretty but they cook and taste fine!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Remember to keep dusting your gnocchi, especially if you are putting them in a bowl before cooking. I just toss them all each time I add more to the bowl.</li>
        <li>Boil the gnocchi: Use lots of salted water (6 quarts) in a big pot, bring to boil, add the gnocchi.
            <ul>
                <li>Have a colander or sieve-strainer And a slotted spoon ready.</li>
                <li>Have a pan with your preferred sauce ready and warming (any jarred pasta sauce works), because you're going to transfer drained gnocchi right into it.</li>
                <li>Boil about half the gnocchi at a time, stirring gently as it cooks. After it floats to the top of the water, cook about 1 more minute. Scoop out and drain gnocchi. Leave your boiling water alone.</li>
                <li>Drop drained gnocchi right into your sauce. Alternately (maybe you want to fry the gnocchi in butter, or just toss with butter and parm into a bowl), you can set it aside in your colander until the second batch is done.</li>
                <li>Repeat with second half of gnocchi.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>After gnocchi has boiled, finish with your pasta sauce of choice (or fry in your fat of choice and season, or toss with butter/cheese, etc.). I heat it in a pan with jarred sauce until everything is the right temp to serve.</li>
        <li>Plate/bowl and serve! Tastes really good with fresh parmesan, olive oil drizzle, herbs, red pepper, etc.</li>
