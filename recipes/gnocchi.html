    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>If you are like me, you can't get pre-packaged gnocchi in
       your local grocery store! The great news is that
       it's relatively easy to make gnocchi from scratch
       if you've got potatoes, egg, and flour. It takes a couple hours
       start to finish, but about half of that time is passive (the potatoes
       are baking). Recipe adapted from <link a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/easy-gnocchi-recipe/">
       Natasha's Kitchen.</link>
       Makes 4 servings. Enjoy!
