    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup oats (quick or old fashioned, but not steel cut)</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Better than Bouillon, any flavor (I like chicken or vegetable)</li>
        <li> Optional seasoning ideas (mix, match, follow your heart)
            <ul>
                <li>One or two shakes of red pepper flakes</li>
                <li>One garlic clove, chopped</li>
                <li>Dried onion flakes</li>
                <li>Couple shakes of black pepper</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
                <li>Parmesan</li>
                <li>Paprika</li>
                <li>Etc.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
       
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Put all ingredients into microwave safe bowl and stir (to break up the bouillon).
            <ul>
                <li>Your oats are going to bubble up a bit, so make sure it's a bigger bowl.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Microwave on regular/high power for 4 minutes.
            <ul>
                <li>You know your microwave best! If 4 minutes on high doesn't make sense, go with your usual oatmeal settings and keep an eye on it.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Stir the oats. If they are very watery, heat for another minute at a time.
            <ul>
                <li>If they're only a little watery, just let them sit while your oats cool. They'll thicken.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Add any final toppings you'd like-- giardiniera, salsa, hot sauce, more spices, melty cheese, butter, fried egg, fermented veggies, etc.</li>
        <li>If you're feeling weird about your oatmeal being savory, remember: cheese grits/polenta/rice porridge are similar and super tasty!</li>
